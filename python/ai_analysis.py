"""AI market analysis — a language model reading a market, out loud.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. The terminal already tells you what a market IS: the price,
the book, the tape, who resolves it and on what source. What it cannot do is
read three paragraphs of resolution criteria and tell you the trap in the
wording, or name the two events between now and close that actually decide
it. That is reading comprehension over text, which is the one thing a
language model is unambiguously good at. So that is all this asks it to do.

THE RULE THAT SHAPES EVERYTHING BELOW: NO NUMBER.

This app refuses to print confident figures it cannot source. `cross_venue`
withholds the spread entirely below its confidence floor, because a
fictional edge is exactly the sort of number somebody trades on. A language
model will cheerfully produce "I estimate 68%" for any question you put to
it, with no calibration behind it, no backtest, and a fluency that reads
like authority. That number would be the least trustworthy figure anywhere
in this application and it would look like the most trustworthy.

So the model is not asked for one, and — more to the point — it is not GIVEN
ANYWHERE TO PUT ONE. The response schema has no numeric field. Not a
probability, not a fair value, not an edge. `additionalProperties: false`
means the provider's own structured-output enforcement rejects one before it
ever reaches us. That is a structural guarantee rather than a prompt
instruction, for the same reason `_HOSTS` is a fixed table rather than a URL
validator: the structural version cannot be talked out of it.

What the user gets instead is a LEAN from a four-word vocabulary — the
market looks cheap, rich, about right, or the model has no view — with the
reasoning that produced it. A direction and an argument, which a person can
weigh, rather than a decimal, which a person tends to just believe.

Free text is still free text, so a model can smuggle "roughly 70% likely"
into a sentence. `_strip_numeric_estimates` removes that sentence and the
panel reports how many it removed. Factual figures survive — "CPI came in at
2.4%", "resolves above $110,000" — because those are the market's numbers,
not the model's guess.

WHAT LEAVES THE MACHINE. Public market data only: the question, the rules
text, the current price, volume, close time and resolver. Never the wallet,
never a position, never a cost basis, never an order. `build_payload` is the
only thing that constructs the outbound body and it takes a market dict, not
an account. Every provider host is declared in `terminal._HOSTS` (the four
beyond Anthropic/OpenAI by `ai_providers` at import), so the offline switch
reaches the cloud ones, the 429 park applies, and the privacy panel counts
them like every other host.

SIX PROVIDERS, ONE GUARANTEE. Anthropic and OpenAI enforce `_SCHEMA` as a
strict structured output. OpenRouter (routed only to endpoints that honour
`response_format`), Gemini (`responseSchema`, with web search off), Ollama
(`format`) and LM Studio (`response_format`) are each asked for it by their
own documented mechanism — but "the provider promised" is not the whole of
the guarantee for any of them. Every reply, from every provider, then passes
`_conform`: a reply with a key outside the schema, a value of the wrong type,
or a NUMBER anywhere (a float, an int, in any field, at any depth) is
rejected outright and never shown. What survives is scrubbed sentence by
sentence. So a provider that ignores the schema can produce a failed
analysis, never a number on the panel.

COST. Every call is metered and the user pays their own provider. Analysis
is therefore explicitly on-demand — a button, never a poll, never a tick.
Nothing in this module is reachable from an engine loop.

_SYSTEM = """\
You are reading a single prediction market on behalf of a trader who is \
looking at its price, its order book and its resolution rules on screen \
right now. Your job is reading comprehension, not forecasting.

Do these things:
  - Explain what the market actually turns on, in plain language.
  - Read the resolution criteria adversarially. Prediction markets are lost \
far more often to wording than to being wrong about the world: a market can \
settle against you on a technicality you did not read. Name those.
  - Name the concrete, dated events between now and close that would move it.
  - State honestly what you do not know. You are a language model with a \
training cutoff, you cannot see the order book beyond the single quote you \
were given, and you may be reading a market about something that happened \
after you were trained. Say so, specifically.
  - Then give a directional lean relative to the quoted price, with the \
argument that produced it.

NEVER state a numeric probability, percentage likelihood, fair value or \
edge for this market. Not in any field, not in passing, not hedged. You have \
no calibration for this question and a number from you would read as \
authoritative when it is not. Give the direction and the argument; the \
person reading decides the size. Quoting a figure that is a FACT about the \
world is fine and expected — an inflation print, a strike price, a poll \
number, a date. The prohibition is on a figure that represents YOUR estimate \
of this market's outcome.

If the rules text is thin, or the question turns on something after your \
cutoff, prefer "no_view" and say why in unknowns. An honest "I cannot tell" \
is worth more here than a confident guess, and the person reading this can \
tell the difference.\
