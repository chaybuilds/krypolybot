"""Compile / execute user strategy scripts, and contain how long they run.

A user script is ordinary Python that defines `decide(ctx)` (plus optional
`decide_market` / `manage` / `decide_signal` / `supervise` /
`on_start` / `on_fill` / `on_settle` hooks).

NO LANGUAGE SANDBOX. Scripts run as full Python with the real builtins, in
the same process as the trading engine — which is the process holding the
decrypted wallet key. This is deliberate: the AST whitelist that used to
gate scripts blocked imports, classes, and most of the standard library,
which made every non-trivial strategy fight the tool, while never being a
real security boundary (CPython sandboxes are escapable, and the module said
so). Rather than pretend, the app now REVIEWS instead of restricting:
`script_audit.py` statically scans every script for network, filesystem,
subprocess, dynamic-exec, environment and wallet/key access — plus
obfuscation, which is flagged as its own critical finding — and the Scripts
page shows those findings before the script is enabled or armed.

Read a script before you run it. The audit is a smoke detector, not a lock.

WHAT THIS MODULE STILL GUARANTEES is liveness, not safety: a script cannot
wedge the engine.

  • Live engine — every hook runs in a joined daemon thread with a hard
    wall-clock timeout (`script_engine._run_bounded`). A hook that blocks
    past it is abandoned and the script is auto-disabled, so the master loop
    keeps its cadence no matter what the script does.
  • Backtest — thousands of hook calls per run, far too many to give each
    its own thread, so the replay path opts into `traced=True`: a wall-clock
    tracer that raises inside the script's own frame. Without it a single
    `while True:` in decide() would hang the backend's RPC forever.

The MONEY rails (max entry price, max size, max open, per-script daily-loss
breaker, one-entry-per-window) live in script_engine and apply to every
script unconditionally. Removing the language sandbox did not touch them.
