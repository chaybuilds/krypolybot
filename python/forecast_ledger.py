"""Every agent fair value, kept until the market resolves, then scored.

The question this answers is the only one that matters before anybody lets an
agent size a position: *does it beat the price?* Not "is it usually right" — a
model that says 90% on every market priced at 90¢ is usually right and has no
edge at all. The benchmark is the market's own mid at the moment the forecast
was made, and the score is the Brier score of each against what actually
happened.

Whose numbers these are. The app itself never prices a market — the AI
analysis panel is number-free by construction (ai_analysis.py). The numbers
here are the AGENTS' own: an agent must commit to a fair value before it may
buy (mcp_tools.vet), and this ledger is how its claim gets checked. It is a
measurement of somebody else's number, never an estimate the app makes.

Rules this module holds to:

  * The comparison is PAIRED. A forecast is scored against the mid that existed
    when it was made, never a later one — scoring a 2pm forecast against the
    5pm price would hand the market the afternoon's news for free, or take it
    away.
  * A forecast made when there was no two-sided quote has no market to beat.
    Its market Brier is None, it is counted in the agent-only score, and it is
    excluded from the head-to-head rather than compared against an invented
    50¢.
  * One forecast per market per agent is scored. Re-asking five times on one
    market must not count as five pieces of evidence. It is the first one a
    buy that went out cited (the one the edge gate let the money in on), else
    the most recent: nothing recorded after the trade can replace the number
    the trade was argued on.
  * "The agent beat the market" is a claim that needs a sample. Under
    MIN_SCORED the verdict is "too-few", and inside two standard errors it is
    "indistinguishable".

Outcomes come from the same resolution reader the Track screen and the paper
book use (terminal_trade._resolutions_for), so the three can never disagree
about what a market paid.

A market UMA resolves 50-50 (a cancelled game, a series game never played:
both tokens redeem for 50c) is scored with outcome 0.5 — the YES payout it
actually made, read by the same rule the paper book settles it with
(terminal_paper.split_resolution). Brier is a proper score for any outcome in
[0, 1], so (p - 0.5)^2 against (mid - 0.5)^2 is still a fair paired
comparison: a fair value is a price of the YES token, and that token paid
50c. Excluding splits instead would leave them pending forever and quietly
drop the markets where a confident forecast was most wrong about what the
contract would pay. In the reliability table a split counts as half a YES.
