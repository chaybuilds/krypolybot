"""Shared SSL context for outbound WebSocket (wss://) connections.

Frozen (PyInstaller) builds — macOS especially — ship a Python whose OpenSSL
default verify paths don't exist on the host, so `websockets.connect` fails
every wss handshake with SSLCertVerificationError (unable to get local issuer
certificate) while httpx REST calls keep working (httpx verifies against the
bundled certifi CA store). Build the websocket context from that same certifi
bundle so both stacks trust the same roots on every platform.
