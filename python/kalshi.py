"""Kalshi — a second venue, read-only.

Why this exists: Polymarket and Kalshi list overlapping questions, and seeing
the SAME question priced on both is useful context — a second opinion from a
different pool of traders. It needs no trust, because the user can open the
Kalshi page and check the number themselves.

This is REFERENCE DATA. The app reads Kalshi and never trades on it, and the
difference between the two prices is presented as information about the two
markets, not as an opportunity.

Three rules specific to a second venue.

1. **NEVER BLUR THE VENUES.** Kalshi is a CFTC-regulated US exchange;
   Polymarket is not the same thing legally, and their fees, settlement
   guarantees and resolution sources differ. Every row carries its venue, and
   the comparison panel states the difference rather than implying the two
   numbers are interchangeable.

2. **A MATCH IS A CLAIM, NOT A FACT.** Nothing tells us these two markets ask
   the same question; we are inferring it from words and dates. So a match
   carries a confidence and the matched title verbatim, and below the
   confidence bar we refuse to print a spread at all — a made-up "edge" on a
   mismatched pair is worse than no panel.

3. **PUBLIC ENDPOINTS ONLY.** No key, no auth, no orders. Everything here is
   the read side of a venue we do not trade on from this app.

Requests ride the SAME gate as the Polymarket providers (see terminal._HOSTS),
so the offline switch, the 429 park and the privacy panel's counters all cover
Kalshi automatically.
