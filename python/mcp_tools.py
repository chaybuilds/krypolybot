"""The tools an AI agent gets over MCP — and the gates in front of them.

Every tool is a thin wrapper over the SAME function the app's own screens
call (``service._h_*`` or the module behind it). That is the whole design: an
agent cannot end up with a looser path than a click, and any gate added to the
app later applies here for free.

Gates, in one place so they cannot drift:

    read      with the server on. Market data, account, history, backtests of
              the built-in engines (replays never place orders).
    trade     the agent's effective mode (mcp_rails.agent_mode): off, paper
              (its OWN paper account) or live. Every order passes
              mcp_rails.vet — forecast first, edge after fee, caps, rules,
              loss stop, and it sells only what it opened.
    derisk    with the server on. Pausing engines. Getting out is never gated.
    switches  ``mcp_allow_live_switches``. Whole-account powers: switching
              engines on, arming scripts / the crypto schedule live, changing
              engine settings, flattening the wallet, live Perps actions.
    scripts   ``mcp_scripts_enabled``. Writing / running strategy code, which
              executes as full Python in the process holding the wallet key.

A refusal is returned as a tool error with a sentence that says why and what
the USER would have to change — never silently, never as an empty result.
