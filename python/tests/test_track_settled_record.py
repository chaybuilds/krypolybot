""""Show settled" must show the RECORD, not the wallet's dust.

The owner's report, after the ledger repair landed: *"when i click on show
settled doesnt show any wins, only 105 losses, but i have 453 wins and 117
losses."*

Every one of those 105 rows was true. The table was still a lie, because of
what it could not contain. `/positions` is the WALLET, and on a prediction
market a wallet is a survivorship filter with the sign flipped:

  * a resolved WINNER leaves it the moment it is redeemed — and a redemption
    is an on-chain claim, not a CLOB trade, so it leaves no sell row either;
  * a resolved LOSER stays in it forever as $0 dust, because there is nothing
    to claim and no reason to spend the gas.

So the wallet's settled rows are, by construction, the losses and only the
losses. `settled_record()` reads the FILL LEDGER instead: every market it ever
settled, paid or not, still held or not.

Shaped from the same real wallet as `test_track_real_cases.py` and
`test_track_ledger_record.py`. Public market ids only — a condition id names a
market, not a person.
