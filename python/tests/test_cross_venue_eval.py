"""The cross-venue matcher, measured — not asserted about in the abstract.

`test_cross_venue.py` pins the individual rules. This file answers the only
question the user actually asked: *does it find the Kalshi market when one
exists, and does it stay quiet when one does not?*

IT RUNS THROUGH `compare()`, WHICH IS THE RPC ENTRY POINT, and that is not a
detail. An earlier version of this file called `find_match` directly and
scored 1.00 while the shipped app found nothing for the September 2026 Fed
question: `compare()` was the one caller that fetched the market with its raw
Gamma row attached, the matcher read Gamma's `startDate` — the LISTING date,
four months before settlement — as the settlement day, and every internal
function still behaved perfectly on the dicts this file was handing it. An
evaluation that does not exercise the real entry point measures the harness.

Two frozen fixtures:

* ``cross_venue_truth.json`` — real Polymarket questions pulled from the
  Discover columns on 2026-09-02/03, each hand-labelled with the ONE Kalshi
  market that asks the same question, or with ``null``. The labels are
  deliberately conservative: a near miss (Kalshi's 15-minute BTC window
  against Polymarket's 5-minute one, "by Dec 31" against "at this event") is
  labelled ``null``, because pairing those would be exactly the confident
  wrong claim this module exists to prevent. Around half have no counterpart
  at all, which is the honest shape of the two venues' overlap.
* ``cross_venue_kalshi_snapshot.json.gz`` — the Kalshi side of that same
  moment: the full series index plus the open events, with their markets, of
  every series the retrieval routes reach. Public, read-only data.

Frozen on purpose. Measured against the live API these numbers drift by the
hour as fixtures settle and 15-minute windows roll, and a bar that moves is
not a bar.

The recorded result on 2026-09-02/03, over these same questions:

    retrieval                       recall   precision
    series titles + market sweep     0.10      1.00      (live, 3 / 31)
    this module                      1.00      1.00      (frozen, 33 / 33)

Two labelled counterparts are excluded from recall: the Getafe and Flamengo
markets had no quote left when the snapshot was taken, and a market with no
resting order is skipped by design rather than compared. They are still
required not to produce some OTHER match.

The bars below sit well under the achieved figures, and deliberately so:
these rules were developed against this fixture, so a perfect score on it is
not evidence of a perfect matcher. It is a floor to regress against, and the
live check (`npm run py:live`) is what samples fresh markets.

PRECISION IS THE ONE THAT MUST NOT SLIP: a missed match is a quiet panel, a
wrong match is a fictional arbitrage with a number under it.
