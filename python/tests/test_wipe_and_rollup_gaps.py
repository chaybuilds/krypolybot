"""Gaps in the wipe, the sweep and the roll-ups.

Every one of these is a figure or a limit that is WRONG rather than missing,
which is the failure mode this codebase treats as the serious one: a "start my
stats fresh" that leaves a track record behind, a per-script cap that stops
counting rows it still holds, and a roll-up that counts simulated money as
real. None of them raise, none of them look broken on screen.
