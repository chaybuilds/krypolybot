"""Authed startup must not walk its independent REST calls in single file.

Boot used to be: cancel-all-resting → reconcile positions → refresh balance,
each awaited in turn — three serial round trips before the loop's first tick
(measured as the bulk of the pre-tick startup cost).

The cancel is a genuine prerequisite (it takes stale GTC orders off the book
and releases their collateral, which both of the others read), so it stays
first. The reconcile and the balance read consume nothing of each other's
results, so they go out together.
