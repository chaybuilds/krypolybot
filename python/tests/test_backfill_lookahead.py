"""The trend backfill must only see candles that had closed at the tick.

Audit 2026-10-11 (latent): crypto15m_backfill grouped ticks by minute and
ended its candle slice at the candle the tick sat IN. A 1-minute candle
stamped HH:MM closes at HH:MM+1, so a tick at HH:MM:05 was given a close
from up to 60s in its future: velocity1mPct / change5mPct / priceVsVwapPct
on backfilled rows knew where the price was going. The slice now ends at
the last candle that had closed when the tick was recorded.

No network: the candle fetch is stubbed.
