"""Realised P&L comes from the FILL LEDGER, not from what the wallet still holds.

Shaped from the same real wallet as `test_track_real_cases.py`, and written
against the complaint that followed the last repair: **"it shows 105 losses,
which is not true — it thinks we lost every bet, so my realised profit shows
-$681.13."**

That was not an arithmetic bug. It was the unit of account.

The Positions tab is the WALLET, and on a prediction market a wallet is a
survivorship filter with the sign flipped:

  * a resolved WINNER leaves the wallet the moment it is redeemed, and a
    redemption is an on-chain claim rather than a CLOB trade — so it leaves no
    "sell" row in the fill ledger either;
  * a resolved LOSER stays in the wallet forever as $0 dust, because there is
    nothing to claim and no reason to spend the gas.

So summing realised P&L over "positions we still hold, plus explicit sells"
drops every single win by construction and totals the losses. On the author's
real wallet that read: 584 markets traded, 453 of them redeemed for a payout,
and a Track screen reporting 105 positions, 105 losses, realised -$681.13.

The fix these tests pin: settle EVERY market the ledger has fills for at $1 per
contract on the winning outcome and $0 on the loser, whether or not the tokens
are still in the wallet — a redeemed winner has already been PAID. An
unresolved market realises from its sells only, and a market whose outcome we
cannot read stays UNKNOWN and is counted as such. Never as a loss.

Public market ids only. No wallet address, no key: a condition id names a
market, not a person.
