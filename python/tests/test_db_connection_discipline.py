"""Static discipline checks on how the codebase uses `db.get_db()`.

`db.get_db()` reuses one connection per WORKER thread (see the long comment
above it in db.py). Two properties have to hold for that to stay safe, and
neither is visible at any single call site — so they are checked here, over the
AST of every backend module, and a regression fails the suite instead of
corrupting a trade ledger in production.

1. NO TRANSACTION HELD OPEN ACROSS AN `await`.
   `with db.get_db() as conn:` opens a transaction and commits it on the way
   out. If the block awaits, another coroutine runs inside that window; on a
   shared connection its writes join the SAME transaction and its block exit
   commits the suspended coroutine's half-written rows. Two such blocks exist
   today and are listed in ALLOWED_AWAIT_BLOCKS below — which is precisely why
   reuse is currently limited to threads with no running event loop. This test
   stops the list from growing, and empties it when those two are fixed.

2. NO NESTED `with get_db()` ON ONE THREAD.
   A helper that opens its own connection while its caller holds one relies on
   the inner block committing/rolling back independently. `get_db()` honours
   that (an already-checked-out cache hands out a private connection), but the
   nesting is worth knowing about, so it is pinned at zero.
