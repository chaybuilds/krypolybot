"""The audit's refusal path — what happens to source it cannot read.

`audit()` is called on the save RPC before a script is written, so anything
it raises is a 500 the user cannot read and cannot act on. `ast.parse` raises
more than `SyntaxError`, and a tree that parses can still be too deep to
walk; both used to escape. The rule this file pins is the module's own: a
verdict we could not reach is stated as a refusal, never as silence.

Every source here is comfortably inside `script_sandbox.MAX_CODE_BYTES`
(128 KB) — none of this needs a large file.
