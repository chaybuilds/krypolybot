"""The six AI providers: one capability table, one error table, one transport.

Anthropic and OpenAI keep their SDK paths for the analysis call and the
Autopilot loop (ai_analysis / autopilot); everything else about them — the
free model listing, the key check, the error wording — is here, next to the
four providers this module carries calls for: OpenRouter, Gemini, Ollama and
LM Studio.

Why this is not one "OpenAI-compatible" client pointed at four base URLs
(ported from kryptrader's ai_providers, where the reasoning was earned):

  * **Gemini** speaks its own REST API. A bad Gemini key comes back as HTTP
    **400** with `reason: API_KEY_INVALID`, not 401 — a status-code mapper
    reads that as "bad request". Web search (Google Search grounding) returns
    its sources as `groundingMetadata`, which the compatibility layer drops.
    The key goes in the `x-goog-api-key` header, never in a URL query string
    that could end up in a logged request line.
  * **Ollama** is called on its native `/api/chat`, not its `/v1` shim,
    because only the native API takes `options.num_ctx` and `format` (a JSON
    schema). Ollama's default context is a few thousand tokens and it
    truncates silently from the FRONT of the conversation when a prompt
    overflows — which drops the system prompt, the one telling the model it
    may not state a number. We set the window explicitly and refuse a prompt
    that would not fit rather than let it be cut.
  * **OpenRouter and LM Studio** really are Chat Completions servers, so they
    share one transport. They still differ in auth, web search, cost
    reporting and in what each failure means.

Rules this module holds:

  * No URLs or hosts from callers. Every base URL is a constant here. Callers
    name a provider id and a model id; a model id is shape-checked before it
    travels, and Gemini's — which lands in the URL PATH — may not contain a
    slash at all.
  * Local means local: the two local providers are reached on 127.0.0.1 (not
    "localhost", which on Windows can resolve to ::1 first while Ollama
    listens on IPv4 only), with the environment's proxy settings ignored so a
    corporate proxy cannot swallow a loopback call.
  * Redirects are never followed. httpx strips `Authorization` on a
    cross-origin redirect but knows nothing about `x-goog-api-key`.
  * Model listings and key checks use free endpoints only.
  * No attribution headers (OpenRouter's `HTTP-Referer` / `X-Title` would put
    this app's usage on a public leaderboard).
  * Every cloud host is a `terminal._HOSTS` entry, so the offline switch
    reaches it, a 429 parks it, and the privacy panel counts it. The two local
    servers are listed too (the panel names every host), but offline mode does
    not block them: a call to 127.0.0.1 never leaves the machine.
  * A key is never logged and never returned. It arrives as an argument from
    ai_secrets and leaves only in a request header.
