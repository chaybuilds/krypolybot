"""At-rest storage for the AI provider API keys.

An LLM API key is a credential with a bill attached: whoever holds it can
spend the user's money at the provider. So it is stored exactly the way the
wallet key and the chat-bot tokens are — through ``polymarket_auth``'s secret
writer, which picks the best backend available (Windows DPAPI → OS keychain →
a chmod-600 plaintext fallback that logs loudly about itself).

Deliberately NOT in settings.json or app_kv: those are plain files the user
copies around, pastes into support threads and syncs to cloud drives. A
leaked wallet key costs the user their funds; a leaked provider key costs
them a runaway bill on somebody else's rate card. Both belong behind the
same door.

Unlike the wallet key, this one is NOT a security boundary for the app: an
attacker holding it cannot touch the wallet, cannot place an order, and
cannot read a position. It buys them inference. That is worth saying plainly
so nobody over-rotates on it — but it is still the user's money, so it is
still encrypted.

The key is never sent back to the renderer. ``masked()`` returns a shape the
user can recognise on the Settings screen without the screen itself becoming
a place the key leaks from.
