"""The money rails every AI agent order passes, in one place.

An agent is a language model with the user's wallet in reach, and a model can
be wrong, be talked into things, or loop. So nothing here trusts what it says
about itself. Every rule below is enforced in the backend, on every order, as
the named agent the request's TOKEN belongs to (mcp_agents) — never as the
client name it gives, and never as whatever its guide says.

THE RAILS (vet)
    * Mode. The global trade mode is the master (off | paper | live); an agent
      only trades live when the global mode AND its own mode say live, and the
      app's paper switch narrows live to paper for everyone.
    * No buy without a forecast. A buy must cite a fair value THIS agent
      recorded on THIS market within FORECAST_TTL_SEC, and the limit must beat
      it by the minimum edge AFTER Polymarket's taker fee. An unknown fee is
      not a zero fee: the edge cannot be checked, so the buy is refused.
    * The agent's own rules (mcp_agents.entry_blockers) — categories from
      Polymarket's own tags, price band, time to close, sides.
    * Money. Per order and per UTC day, all agents together AND each agent's
      own (which can only be stricter). Queued approvals count as spent.
    * Positions. Open markets across every active agent, and per agent; shares
      per market per agent.
    * Daily loss stop. Realised today plus open losses at the bid, every
      agent together. Unrealised gains never offset. An unreadable book counts
      at full cost; an unreadable live ledger refuses buys.
    * Ownership. An agent sells or cancels only what IT opened: its paper book
      is its own account, and live it may sell only what its own orders
      actually FILLED (terminal_fills, by order id) — never what they asked
      for — less what it has already sold or set a live stop for.
    Exits are never capped, never blocked by a rule or the loss stop.

THE LIVE LEDGER (mcp_orders.status, live rows)
    NULL / approved  sent; a GTC may still rest, so a buy counts its full
                     size and cost, a sell its full size
    filled / partial a fill-and-kill whose fill is KNOWN (the rest was
                     killed): it counts what filled, nothing more
    unmatched        a fill-and-kill that crossed nothing: zero
    cancelled        cancelled at what it had filled (any cancel path, or
                     found cancelled on the venue)
    refused          the venue (or the ticket, before sending) definitely
                     placed nothing: counts nowhere, holds no slot
    unknown          may or may not be on the venue: counts in full (fail
                     closed) until reconcile finds it or the user settles it
                     (settle_unknown, RPC mcpSettleUnknown)
    void             an 'unknown' the user settled after Polymarket showed
                     no such order and no fill: counts nowhere

APPROVALS ("ask me first", on by default)
    A live agent order is queued, the user approves it in the app or by phone,
    and it is RE-VETTED at the moment of approval against the market as it is
    then. It counts against the daily cap while it waits and expires after
    APPROVAL_TTL_SEC.

ATOMICITY
    vet → send → record runs under one lock for ALL agents, so two parallel
    calls (or two agents, or two approvals clicked together) cannot both
    squeeze under a cap that fits one.
