"""Fee-aware signal backtest for Krypt PolyBot.

Answers the only question that matters before hardening anything else:
**do the scanner's signals have positive expectancy after Polymarket fees?**

It replays every *resolved* signal the scanners recorded (`whale_trades`
and `alerts`), computes the per-contract P&L of having followed it at the
recorded entry price given the binary outcome, **subtracts an estimate of
the Polymarket trading fee**, and reports net edge with a significance check
and a confidence-threshold sweep.

This is a realized-signal backtest, not an academic one: it measures the
net-of-fee edge of the signals this bot actually produces. It does NOT
prove forward performance (no look-ahead controls, the scoring is the
same one that generated the signals), but it is the honest first cut at
"does this make money after costs."

    python backtest.py                 # auto-find your Krypt PolyBot DB
    python backtest.py --db PATH       # explicit DB
    python backtest.py --fee 0.07      # override the taker-fee rate coefficient
    python backtest.py --spread 2      # cents paid over each signal's price (default 1)
    python backtest.py --demo          # synthetic data, to see the format

FEE MODEL (fee v2, re-verified 2026-08-18 against docs.polymarket.com; first
verified 2026-07-03 against a live market's Gamma `feeSchedule`): Polymarket
charges TAKERS ONLY a fee per contract = rate × P·(1−P) — a symmetric curve
peaking at mid prices and vanishing at the extremes. Rates by category:
Crypto 0.07, Sports 0.05 (raised from 0.03 in July 2026),
Finance/Politics/Mentions/Tech 0.04, Economics/Culture/Weather/Other 0.05,
Geopolitics free. Makers pay 0 (and earn rebates). This replaces the
June-2026 flat rate×price model, which overestimated fees ~8.6× at the
95-98c prices the 15m engine buys. When a signal carries a category the rate
is looked up (the bot's own climate / entertainment / world ids map onto
weather / culture / other); a blank or unknown category is rated 'other'
(0.05), the same fallback the live accounting uses. --fee forces a single
rate coefficient for everything. Schedule re-checked 2026-10-11 against
docs.polymarket.com/trading/fees: unchanged.
